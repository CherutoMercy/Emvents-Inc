Milestone: Build an in-memory RESTful API

Like we often do in product development, we will start by building an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). During this milestone, you will build a simple RESTful API to manage events using, for now, an in-memory data structure (e.g. array) to store the data.

Get ready (6 / 6)
Complete these tasks by yourself before meeting with your partner.

Task #1
Learn how you can use Express.js routing to process different requests from the user of your API.

Task #2
Learn what route paths are and how can you use them to define handlers for users requests.
http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html

Task #3
Learn how you can use ES6 promises to create better and higher quality code.

Task #4
Learn how you can use promises in Express.js and other alternatives (youâ€™ll use promises extensively during the project).

Task #5
Learn what makes an API a RESTful API.

Task #6
Learn how to manage parameters in a Express.js route to collect data from a request.

Requirements (9 / 9)
Complete these requirements during the session with your partner.

Requirement #1
Define a Javascript object that represents an "Event". It should contain an id, title, a description, and a date.

Requirement #2
Add multiple event objects to your data structure (e.g. array or object)

Requirement #3
There should be an endpoint to get a list of all the events

Requirement #4
There should be an endpoint to get one event and all its fields by its id 

Requirement #5
There should be an endpoint that allows to create a new event (i.e. add it to the data structure) 

Requirement #6
There should be an endpoint that allows to update an existing event 

Requirement #7
There should be an endpoint that allows to delete an existing event

Requirement #8
Test your API using Postman

Requirement #9
The implementation should use ES6 promises
