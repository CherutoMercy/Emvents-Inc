Milestone: Introduction

Emvents Inc., a (fictional) tech company based in South Africa, has requested your help with a product they are building. Emvents Inc. wants to create a mobile ticketing app to help people find the best free events in Africa and help organizers reach millions of potential attendees.
The company will build the mobile application for iOS and Android, but they need someone to build the API that they will use as backend. This is where you and your partner come to play. You will work as a team building a REST API using Node.js for them.
This Introductory milestone only has individual tasks to get you ready to start working on the project with your coding partner.

Get ready (4 / 4)

Complete these tasks by yourself before meeting with your partner.
