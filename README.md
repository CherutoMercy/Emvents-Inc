# Building a REST API with Node.js & Express

## Background
At [Microverse](http://www.microverse.org/), we are passionate about helping people learn by working on real-world projects where **we tell you WHAT to build, but never HOW to build it**. Think about it as if we were your Product Managers.

We also have an ongoing program to help young develovers become a professional remote software developers.

## Introduction

The project has been split into multiple milestones, and each milestone has functional and technical requirements that you will need to implement.

## Tools you will use
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- npm
- Mocha
- Chai
- Passport.js
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)

## The Project
Emvents Inc., a (fictional) tech company based in South Africa, has requested your help with a product they are building. Emvents Inc. wants to create a mobile app to help people find the best free events in Africa and help organizers reach millions of potential attendees. 

The company will build the mobile application for iOS and Android, but they need someone to build the API that they will use as backend. This is where you come to play. In this project, you will build a REST API using Node.js for them.
