Milestone: Persisting the API data with Mongodb

So far we have been storing the data in memory, but Emvents Inc. wants to store the data in a persistent way. We will do that using a Mongodb database and the Mongoose ODM (Object Data Modeling).

Get ready (6 / 6)
Complete these tasks by yourself before meeting with your partner.

Task #1
Install mongodb.

Task #2
Familiarize with mongo concepts, like documents and collections.
https://docs.mongodb.com/getting-started/shell/introduction/

Task #3
Use the mongo shell utility to play around. Create a new database with use command. Then, create a new collection for the events by inserting one document in it. Use findOne to get the event you just inserted.

Task #4
Learn how to create, read, update and delete documents from the shell.

Task #5
What is an index and how they could help you improve the performance of your mongodb supported app?
https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.0/core/indexes-introduction/

Task #6
Install mongoose in a sample project and understand how you can use it in you NodeJS app
http://mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html

Requirements (9 / 9)
Complete these requirements during the session with your partner.

Requirement #1
Creating a new event should save the new event into Mongodb. Use the Node.js native driver.
http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/2.2/quick-start/quick-start/

Requirement #2
Updating an existing event should save the changes into Mongodb

Requirement #3
Deleting an event should delete the event from Mongodb.

Requirement #4
Create, update, delete event data into mongodb with the node native driver 

Requirement #5
Refactor the previous code using mongoose.

Requirement #6
The code should be organized using different folders for models, routing, etc.

Requirement #7
The tests created in the previous milestone should still pass.

Requirement #8
Add a new endpoint (and a test) to allow the user to search events by title.

Requirement #9
Create an index in the database to improve performance of this query. Use the mongo shell command “explain” to check the performance improvement.
