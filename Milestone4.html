Milestone: Testing your API

Since we are building this project for a client, we want to make sure we are shipping a high-quality product. In this milestone we will learn how to make sure the RESTful API works properly by using unit testing.

Complete these tasks by yourself before meeting with your partner.

Task #1
Learn the basics of unit testing that allows you to build new code (tests) that checks that your API works as expected.
